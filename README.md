## Usage

The personality test consists of a series of questions that the user can answer on a scale of 1-5. The user's answers are then used to calculate their scores for the Big Five personality traits - extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and experience.

To take the test, simply navigate to the homepage of the web application and start answering the questions. Once all questions have been answered, the user can submit their answers to see their personality trait scores.
